# Orchestrator

Spike orchestrator.

Note: this code has private and shared parts we need to split out at a later point. The end result should be to have
shareable code in a new `canary-monitoring-agent` repo and reuse that code here to do our orchestration. For the
spike, we do not care a lot, the goal is just to replace our orchestrator in ECS.
